# CRM Card

## Introduction 

You can open Krinu and chat with your contacts directly from Hubspot! 

Our integration adds a card to the contacts and deals in Hubspot. The card can be located at the bottom of the right sidebar. See:

![Hubspot CRM Card](../../public/screenshots/crmcard-1.png)

We recommend moving the card up the right sidebar so that it is more accessible. You can do it like this:

Click on `Open Opp` or `Open Contact` to chat with your contact

## Limitations

1. Metrics are computed and refreshed hourly so newly added deals and contacts will not show
2. Does not work on Firefox
3. Contacts must have a phone number
