# WhatsApp

Krinu connects to both WhatsApp app and WhatsApp Business app. We do not support WhatsApp Business API. 

We recommend users use a secondary phone number with WhatsApp Business app for business communications. Both the WhatsApp app and WhatsApp Business app can be installed on the same phone. Doing so allows drawing a clear line between business communications and personal communications.

## Connecting Your Account

On the [Integrations](https://app.krinu.com/integrations) page, click connect on WhatsApp:
